# Plugins in QGIS
### UBC Library Research Commons

This workshop is meant to extend basic knowledge of QGIS by exploring common plugins. Familiarity of the QGIS is therefore a prerequisite. By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to use plugins to 

- Access dynamic basemaps hosted on web servers
- Query and download Open Street Map (OSM) data 
- Geocode address data from a spreadsheet, and
- Create an interactive webmap from a QGIS project (see below for example)
