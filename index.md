# Plugins in QGIS

This workshop is meant to extend basic knowledge of QGIS by exploring common plugins. Familiarity of the QGIS is therefore a prerequisite. By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to use plugins to 

- Access dynamic basemaps hosted on web servers
- Query and download Open Street Map (OSM) data 
- Geocode address data from a spreadsheet, and
<!--use list of libraries; or use public art data but in csv format-->
- Create an interactive webmap from a QGIS project (see below for example)
<!-- add next steps directions for hosting webmap on github pages -->

## Before the Workshop

>-   **Download QGIS!** QGIS can be downloaded from [qgis.org's Downloads page](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html). In most cases, you'll want to download and install the **Long term release** instead of the latest release - currently **QGIS 3.34.6 'Prizren'**. This will give you most of the functionality you'll need, without encountering the software bugs of newly released versions. [See here](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/gis-intro-qgis/content/installing-qgis.html) for further guidance.

> - **Familiarity with the QGIS interface is prerequisite for this workshop.** Check out the Research Commons' [Map Production with QGIS](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/gis-intro-qgis/) and [Tools and Workflows in QGIS](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/gis-tools-workflows/) workshops if you are new to GIS, or your background is in Esri ArcGIS products. You can also browse the QGIS Documentation's [Getting Started](https://docs.qgis.org/3.34/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/getting_started.html) for a refresher. 
Familiarity with QGIS is prerequisite for this workshop. 
> Although this workshop will entail making a web map powered by Leaflet, no prior knowledge of coding or webmapping is necessary. Indeed, the QGIS plugin you will be introduced to specifically circumvents the need to build a web map with code. However, understanding the way Leaflet works to power a web map may make your experience more interesting. If you'd like a gentle introduction to Leaflet, check out the Research Commons' workshop: [Introduction to webmapping with Leaflet](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/gis-intro-leaflet/).
