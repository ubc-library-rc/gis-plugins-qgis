# Webmapping with QGIS using qgis2web plugin

Want to convert your QGIS project into a dynamic and interactive webmap? There's a plugin for that! [qgis2web](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/qgis2web/) allows you to seamlessly create a webmap from your project that preserves your layers *and* their symbology. This next section will guide you through turning your current QGIS project into a webmap powered by Leaflet. See the Research Commons' [Webmapping with Leaflet](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/gis-intro-leaflet/) workshop for an introduction if you're interested.
